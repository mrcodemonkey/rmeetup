"description": "<p>This group was created for those who are interested in learning the practice of Yin Yoga. Beginners and advanced yogis are all welcome! As a Yoga Therapist and certified Yin Yoga teacher, it is my hope to help make Yin Yoga more available than it currently is in New York City, a place where it is most definitely needed. It is my belief that Yoga should be available to all, regardless of age, experience or economic status. My classes will be held on a donation basis with students paying what they can afford per class.</p>
<p>This particular class will be a two hour workshop that includes Yin Yoga with an added Yang Yoga flow. The workshop will be ended with a 25 minute Restorative Yoga session.</p>
<p>Come experience the profound power of balancing Yin and Yang. Yin yoga is a practice for all from beginners to advanced. It is a challenging practice that expresses the theories of Chinese Medicine and Daoism. Known as "Yoga for the joints and connective tissues of the body", Yin Yoga particularly targets the hip and knee joints for relief from joint and low back pain. Dramatically increase flexibility and endurance while decreasing physical and emotional stess and pain. Hope to see you there!!</p>
<p><strong><span style="color : #000080">****Please note, this is a Two Hour Workshop that will be held from 9:00AM to 10:00AM. Space will be limited so please RSVP to reserve your spot&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color : #000080">&nbsp;</span></strong>Please visit my website, www.freeyourjoints.com for more details about me and my teaching style.</p>
<p>Please RSVP through meetup.com or to my email at; freeyourjoints@gmail.com. Space is limited so please confirm that you will be attending. If you confirm yes for your space, please be true to that commitment. If you cannot make it, please let me know within 24 hours so that your spot can be given to another Yogi who may be waiting for it. Thank you kindly.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color : #800000">The Yoga Collective is a fully stocked studio. Mats and props will be provided. Bring water and a towel, if needed.</span></strong></p>
